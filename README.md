# Decentralized Voting System

<<<<<<< HEAD
A blockchain-based decentralized voting system built using Ethereum smart contracts and modern web technologies.

## Features

- Secure and transparent voting process
- Immutable vote records on the blockchain
- Real-time vote counting and results
- Voter privacy through cryptographic techniques
- Admin dashboard for election management
- User-friendly interface for voters

## Technology Stack

- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Ethereum Blockchain
- Web3.js
- React.js
- Hardhat (Development Framework)
- MetaMask (Wallet Integration)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd decentralized-voting-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Hardhat globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g hardhat
   ```

4. Configure your local environment:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
     INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
     ```

5. Compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

6. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Smart Contract Structure

The main smart contract `VotingSystem.sol` contains the following key functions:

- `registerVoter`: Register a new voter (admin only)
- `addCandidate`: Add a new candidate (admin only)
- `startVoting`: Start the voting period (admin only)
- `castVote`: Cast a vote for a candidate
- `endVoting`: End the voting period (admin only)
- `getResults`: Get the voting results

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive operations are protected by access control
- Voter privacy is maintained through cryptographic techniques
- Smart contract includes checks against double voting
- Real-time validation of voting eligibility

=======
This project is a secure and transparent decentralized voting system built using **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, and **React.js**. The system leverages blockchain technology to ensure immutable vote records, prevent manipulation, and provide a reliable voting platform.

## Features

### **Smart Contract (********`contracts/VotingSystem.sol`********)**

- Implements core voting functionality
- Manages voter registration, candidate management, and vote casting
- Ensures security through access control and voter verification
- Provides automated vote counting and result retrieval

### **Test Suite (********`test/VotingSystem.test.js`********)**

- Comprehensive tests for:
  - Contract deployment
  - Voter registration
  - Candidate management
  - Voting process
  - Results accuracy

### **Deployment Script (********`scripts/deploy.js`********)**

- Automates contract deployment to various networks
- Includes contract verification on Etherscan for transparency

### **Configuration Files**

- **`hardhat.config.js`**: Defines network configurations and compiler settings
- **`package.json`**: Manages project dependencies and scripts
- **`.gitignore`**: Ensures unnecessary files are excluded from version control

### **User Interface (UI)**

Built with **React.js** and **Chakra UI**, the UI ensures smooth interaction for voters and administrators.

#### **Voter Features**

- View registered candidates
- Cast votes securely with MetaMask integration
- Monitor voting status and remaining time
- View real-time election results

#### **Admin Features**

- Register voters securely
- Add and manage candidates
- Start and end voting sessions
- Monitor voting progress in real-time
- View and analyze election results

### **Security Features**

- **Access Control:** Restricts administrative actions to authorized personnel
- **Prevention of Double Voting:** Ensures each voter can cast their vote only once
- **Time-Based Voting Periods:** Enforces deadlines to manage voting sessions
- **Voter Privacy:** Utilizes address-based identification for anonymity
- **Wallet Authentication:** Ensures secure access through MetaMask

### **Enhanced UI Design**

- Clean and intuitive layout
- Real-time updates and status tracking
- Dark/light mode support
- Error handling with informative messages
- Mobile responsiveness for broader accessibility

## Installation Guide

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RelaxOnBnb/Decentralized-Voting-System.git
cd Decentralized-Voting-System
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

### **4. Run Tests**

```bash
npm test
```

### **5. Deploy the Contract**

In one terminal:

```bash
npm run node
```

In another terminal:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### **6. Start the Frontend Application**

```bash
npm start
```

## Future Enhancements
